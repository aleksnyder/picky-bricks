# Picky Bricks
Chrome Extension to replace all occurrences of inccorect spellings of LEGO with the correct spelling.

The LEGO group prefers it this way:

> Please always refer to our products as “LEGO bricks or toys” and not “LEGO bricks.” By doing so, you
> will be helping to protect and preserve a brand of which we are very proud, and that stands for
> quality the world over.
